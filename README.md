## Olaolu's website

This repo is home for the codebase of my site and shelf of articles.

## Project setup

- Run `yarn serve` for development: Simultaneously kicks off
  `vue-cli-service serve` for the homepage Vue app and `gridsome develop` for
  the shelf app.

- Run `yarn build` for production: Simultaneously runs `vue-cli-service build`
  for the homepage Vue app and `gridsome build` for the shelf app, and then
  merges the two `dist` directories into a root `dist`.
